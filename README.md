**Exploratory data analysis-World Population-Project**
 🌍 World Population Data Analysis using Python

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a world population dataset using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about global population trends, country-wise distribution, and growth over time using data visualization and analysis techniques.

---

## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize global population data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This analysis helps in understanding population patterns across continents and countries, highlighting growth trends and top contributing nations.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information such as:

- Country/Region
- Population
- Year-wise population growth
- World Share (%)
- Density
- Land Area (km²)
- Migrants (net)


## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Top 10 most populated countries
- Country-wise population distribution
- World population share by country
- Population trends by year
- Correlation between land area and population
- Bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots for visual insights

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – for static visualizations
- **Seaborn** – for enhanced visuals and statistical plots
- **Jupyter Notebook**
